# Hello CityJS participants!

A quick rundown of the dependencies of this Chat App:
- Angular v21
- Node v24.13


## Development server

Run `npm run serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

If you are looking to run the backend node server, run `ng build` first and then `cd server && node server.js` - the entire full stack application will be available on `http://localhost:8080`

## Production

Build the docker image directly and push to production in cloud run!
